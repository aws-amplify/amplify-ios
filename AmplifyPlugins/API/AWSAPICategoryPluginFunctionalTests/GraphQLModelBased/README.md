## Model Based GraphQL 

provisioned without Sync

TODO: These tests are currently not going to work until we introduce the isConfigured check and allow APICategory to check if DataStore plugin isConfigured. Currently it defaults to true.

/*
 The backend is set up using this schema:
 ```
 type Post @model {
     id: ID!
     title: String!
     content: String!
     createdAt: AWSDateTime!
     updatedAt: AWSDateTime
     draft: Boolean
     rating: Float
     commentNoSyncs: [Comment] @connection(name: "PostComment")
 }

 type Comment @model {
     id: ID!
     content: String!
     createdAt: AWSDateTime!
     post: Post @connection(name: "PostComment")
 }

 ```

 Bootstrapping backend

 - for subscriptions, this was done in us-west-2 for the new gogi endpoints.
 - use the schema when adding graphQL API
 - choose API key

 Example CLI workflow:
 `amplify add api`
    ? Please select from one of the below mentioned services `GraphQL`
    ? Provide API name: `modelbasedapi`
    ? Choose the default authorization type for the API `API key`
    ? Enter a description for the API key: `apikey`
    ? After how many days from now the API key should expire (1-365): `180`
    ? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API `No, I am done.`
    ? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? `Yes`
    ? Provide your schema file path: schema.graphql

 `amplify push`
    ? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API `Yes`
    ? Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions `graphql/**/*.graphql`
    ? Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions `Yes`
    ? Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested] `2`
    ? Enter the file name for the generated code `API.swift`


The models exist in AmplifyTestCommon/Models/Post.swift and Comment.Swift, we use these for testing
