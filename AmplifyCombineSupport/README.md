# Combine support for Amplify for iOS

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-mobile-hub-images/aws-amplify-logo.png" alt="AWS Amplify" width="550" >

The default Amplify library for iOS supports iOS 11 and higher, and ships with APIs that return results on `Result` callbacks, as in:

```swift
Amplify.DataStore.save(Post(title: "My Post", content: "My content", ...), completion: { result in
    switch result {
        case .success:
            print("Post saved")
        case .failure(let dataStoreError):
            print("An error occurred saving the post: \(dataStoreError)")
    }
})
```

The AmplifyCombineSupport module extends the base Amplify categories with APIs that return appropriate Combine publishers, which allow developers to use familiar Combine patterns, as in:

```swift
Amplify.DataStore.save(Post(title: "My Post", content: "My content", ...))
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            if case .failure(let dataStoreError) = completion {
                print("An error occurred saving the post: \(dataStoreError)")
            }
        }, receiveValue: { value in
            print("Post saved")
        }
    )
```

While this doesn't save much for a single invocation, it provides great readability benefits when chaining asynchronous calls, since you can use standard Combine publishers to compose complex functionality into readable chunks:

```swift
subscription = Publishers.Zip(
    Amplify.DataStore.save(Person(name: "Rey")),
    Amplify.DataStore.save(Person(name: "Kylo"))
).flatMap { hero, villain in
    Amplify.DataStore.save(EpicBattle(hero: hero, villain: villain))
}.flatMap { battle in
    Publishers.Zip(
        Amplify.DataStore.save(
            Outcome(of: battle)
        ),
        Amplify.DataStore.save(
            Checkpoint()
        )
    )
}.sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
    if case .failure(let dataStoreError) = completion {
        print("An error occurred during one of the preceding operations: \(dataStoreError)")
    }
}, receiveValue: { _ in
    print("Everything completed successfully")
})
```

Compared to nesting these dependent calls in callbacks, this provides a much more readable pattern.

**NOTE**: Remember that Combine publishers do not retain `sink` subscriptions, so you must maintain a reference to the subscription in your code, such as in an instance variable of the enclosing type:

```swift
struct MyAppCode {
    var subscription AnyCancellable?

    ...

    func doSomething() {
        // Subscription is retained by the `self.subscription` instance
        // variable, so the `sink` code will be executed
        subscription = Amplify.DataStore.save(Person(name: "Rey"))
            .sink(...)
    }
}
```

## Installation

Install from CocoaPods by adding the `AmplifyCombineSupport` pod to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Amplify'
pod 'AmplifyCombineSupport'
# ... other pods, such as Amplify plugins
```

## Usage

Use in your projects by importing the `AmplifyCombineSupport` module alongside `Amplify` and `AmplifyPlugins`:

```swift
import Amplify
import AmplifyPlugins
import AmplifyCombineSupport
```

## API Comparison: Standard Amplify vs. `AmplifyCombineSupport`

`AmplifyCombineSupport` strives to provide the same API signature and call patterns as "standard" Amplify, minus the result callbacks. Thus, `Amplify.DataStore.save(_:where:completion:)` has an `AmplifyCombineSupport` equivalent of `Amplify.DataStore.save(_:where:)`. Similarly, the Result callback `Success` and `Failure` types in standard Amplify APIs translate exactly to the `Output` and `Failure` types of `AnyPublisher`s returned from `AmplifyCombineSupport` APIs.

### APIs with in-process listeners
APIs that accept both an "in process" and "result" listener have a CombineSupport flavor that returns a category-specific struct containing both an "in process" and "result" publisher. Callers can subscribe to either or both, as in this example for the Storage category:

```swift
let publisher = Amplify.Storage.downloadData(key: "myObject")
let progressSubscription = publisher.progressPublisher.sink { print($0.fractionCompleted) }
let resultSubscription = publisher.resultPublisher.sink(
    receiveCompletion: { print("Download completed: \($0)") },
    receiveValue: { print("Data downloaded: \($0)") }
)
```

The names of the "in process" and "result" properties vary by API category, to reflect their use case. See the API documentation for details.

### APIs that return operations

The Standard Amplify flavor of most APIs returns a use-case specific Operation that you may use to cancel an in-progress operation. The `AmplifyCombineSupport` APIs do not support cancellation of the operation. Canceling a subscription to a publisher simply releases that publisher, but does not affect the work in the underlying operation.

If your use case requires both Combine-style publisher support and cancellation, you can adapt the standard API, as in this example for the Storage category, without even using `AmplifyCombineSupport` module:

```swift
let progressSubject = PassthroughSubject<Progress, Never>()
let resultSubject = PassthroughSubject<Data, StorageError>()

let progressListener: ProgressListener = {
    progressSubject.send($0)
}

let downloadOperation = Amplify.Storage.downloadData(
    key: "myObject",
    progressListener: progressListener
) { result in
        progressSubject.send(completion: .finished)
    switch result {
    case .failure(let storageError):
        resultSubject.send(completion: .failure(storageError))
    case .success(let data):
        resultSubject.send(data)
        resultSubject.send(completion: .finished)
    }
}

let progressSubscription = progressSubject.sink { print($0.fractionCompleted) }
let resultSubscription = resultSubject.sink(
    receiveCompletion: { print("Download completed: \($0)") },
    receiveValue: { print("Data downloaded: \($0)") }
)

progressSubscription.cancel() // Only cancels subscription, download is still progressing
resultSubscription.cancel() // Only cancels subscription, download is still progressing
downloadOperation.cancel() // Cancels download
```
